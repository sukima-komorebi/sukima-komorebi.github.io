  <h3> Steps on How to Fold an Origami Crane</h3>
  
  <h4>Step 1:</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ztBJxl7.jpeg" alt="Step 1" width="350" height="260"/> 
    <p>You need to find a square piece of origami paper. It could be any size, but I reccomend a 15cm x 15cm because it is easy to work on. </p>
  <h4>Step 2:</h4>

    <p>Fold the paper in half. Make sure the colored side of the paper is at the back, when you fold. two corners should be folded right on top of each other.</p>
  <h4>Step 3:</h4>

    <p>Fold the paper in half again, forming a triangle.</p>
  <h4>Step 4:</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/goL0juD.jpeg" alt="Step 4" width="350" height="260"/> 
    <p>Pull out one flap of the paper, so it forms a square. </p>  
  <h4>Step 5:</h4>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qd0wQM8.jpeg" alt="Step 7" width="350" height="260"/> 
    <p>do the same thing you did in step 4 on the other side of the paper. It should form a square.</p>
  <h4>Step 8:</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pHfyUti.jpeg" alt="Step 8" width="350" height="260"/> 
    <p>Fold in one flap of the paper so that it lines up with the middle crease in the original square. When you do this, make sure the corner with several flaps are placed atthe bottom, closest to you. Do this for both the right and left side. </p>  
  <h4>Step 9:</h4>

    <p>After you made the crease in step 8, fold it back out so it forms a square again. Then, fold the top corner down. When you do this, make sure the tip lines up with the middle crease, and the two non-right corners are at the end of the creases we made in step 8.</p>
  <h4>Step 10:</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hss9u9Z.jpeg" alt="Step 10" width="350" height="260"/> 
    <p>Fold back the corner from step 9 after you made a crease. Pull one flap of the very bottom corner all the way up.</p> 
  <h4>Step 11:</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3bW13f2.jpeg" alt="Step 11" width="350" height="260"/>

    <p>Pull up the bottom part of the paper all of the way up, so that it matches the height of the two flaps at the top. When you do this, make sure the coner with two separate "legs" with a vertical gap in between is at the top, furthest from you.</p>
  <h4>Step 16:</h4>
